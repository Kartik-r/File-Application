This is an Android-based application in which an automatic word count system is implemented 
in the file application. Users can type their text in the text box and save the same.
The system has two major modules which are the create module and save module. The create 
module helps in creating a new file so that the user can enter the text in the textbox and the save 
module saves the text entered. The event is also set with the Open button so that the user can 
open the previously created file and view the content of it.
The system focuses on easy navigation and good user interface. Many such File Application 
have been developed where a new hardware is required but, in our work, we have made an 
attempt to develop a system which is economical and time-saving.
